- Calibration_Call.m & FFT_CM_Call_Kou.m & fun.m go together : Carr-Madan algorithm with Kou model ;
- Calibration_Call_BS.m & FFT_CM_Call_BS.m & fun_CM_BS.m go together : Carr-Madan algorithm with B&S model (GMB). It is useless since we can calibrate the volatility by inverting the B&S formula, but it was useful to check that I was able to manipulate the code. So it was just an exercise for me.
