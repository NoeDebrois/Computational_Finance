% This code implements the computation of characteristic function for a
% given distribution (case 1 : Normal, case 2 : Normal Inverse Gaussian).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

function F = charfunction(u, parameters, flag)
% Computes the characteristic function (conjugated OR not) of a given
% distribution (Normal or Normal Inverse Gaussian) with a correction to
% take into account the RISK-FREE RATE, the potential DIVIDENDS, and the
% fact that, under Q measure, phi_X(-i) = 1 (i.e Psi_X(-i) = 0).
%
% cf FFT.pdf & CONV.pdf : in the computations, to make a convolution appear
% we need to complex-conjugate the characteristic function. That's why :
% flag = 0 for complex conjugate -> characteristic fct backward-in-time ; 
% flag = 1 for NO complex conjugate -> characteristic fct forward-in-time.

if nargin == 2
    flag = 0; % By default, we need the complex conjugate.
end

% To make it risk-neutral :
meancorrection = (parameters.rf - parameters.q) * parameters.dt...
-log(charfunction0(-1i, parameters));

F = exp(1i * meancorrection * u) .* charfunction0(u, parameters);

if flag == 0
    F = conj(F); % We need the complex conjugate to have a convolution.
end
