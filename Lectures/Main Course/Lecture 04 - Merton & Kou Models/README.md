# Merton & Kou Models :
In this folder we show how to simulate Jump Diffusion Lévy processes using Kou & Merton Models. This requires knowing how to simulate the jumptimes (Poisson distribution), jumpsizes (Exponential distribution or Normal distribution).
I also made a notebook which merges the different models to see the differences and compare them.
