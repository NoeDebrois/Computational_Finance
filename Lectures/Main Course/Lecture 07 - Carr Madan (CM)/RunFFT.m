%% LECTURE 7 - Carr-Madan Method - No√© Debrois - 27/10/2024
% This code is calling the Carr-Madan (CM) algorithm for pricing a plain 
% vanilla call option using the Kou model for jump-diffusion processes.
% We call also the BS version to compare.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
clear; close all;

% Parameters :
Strike = [80 90 100 110];
S0 = 102;
T = 1;
r = 0.05;
params = [0.2 3 0.6 20 30];

% Call : 
FFT_CM_Call_Kou(Strike, params, T, r, S0)
%
% It's very fast and with a nice precision.
% It should be great to calibrate to the market, because calibration is a 
% process that requires a lot of iterations, but on plain vanilla objects.
%
% For comparison with the same thing but under B&S model :
FFT_CM_Call_BS(Strike, params, T, r, S0)
% We can see that the prices are quite close.
