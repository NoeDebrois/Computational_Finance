    "### Returns :\n",
    "- Total return : $H_{t,\\tau} = \\frac{P_t}{P_{t-\\tau}}$ : $invariant$ in the equity market ;\n",
    "- Linear return : $L_{t,\\tau} = \\frac{P_t}{P_{t-\\tau}} - 1$ ;\n",
    "- Compounded return : $C_{t,\\tau} = ln(\\frac{P_t}{P_{t-\\tau}})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimators :\n",
    "Imagine our invariants $X_t$ are distributed following $N(\\mu, \\Sigma)$.\n",
    "- The location estimator is the sample mean : $\\hat \\mu [ i_T ] = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} x_t$ ;\n",
    "- The dispersion estimator is the sample covariance matrix : $\\hat \\Sigma [i_T] = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} (x_t - \\hat \\mu)(x_t - \\hat \\mu)'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating allocations :\n",
    "- The allocation (the nb of units bought for each securities) is represented by the N-dimensional vector $\\alpha$ ;\n",
    "- At the time of investment decision, the value of the portfolio is : $w_T(\\alpha) = \\alpha'p_T$ ;\n",
    "- At the investment horizon $\\tau$, the portfolio is a one-dimensional random variable : $W_{T+\\tau}(\\alpha) =Â \\alpha'P_{T+\\tau}$ ;\n",
    "- The investor has one or more $objectives$ $\\Psi$, namely quantities that the investor perceives as beneficial and therefore desires in the largest possible amounts. For example, it can be the absolute wealth : $\\Psi_\\alpha = W_{T+\\tau}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Index of satisfaction :\n",
    "- We can summarize all the features of a given allocation $\\alpha$ into one single number $S$ that indicates the respective degree of satisfaction : $\\alpha \\rightarrow S(\\alpha)$. See the properties, slide $35/57$ in lecture $1$.\n",
    "- See the notion of expected utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building strategies :\n",
    "- A strategy is a set of investment choices based on a determined information set $I_t$, function of the information set : $S(t) = f(I(t))$ ;\n",
    "- Let's assume $N$ is the number of possible investment assets, a single choice could be defined as a signal $s_t^i$ : $S(t) = (s^1_t, s^2_t, ..., s^N_t)$ ;\n",
    "- Equity curve : $X_\\tau = \\Pi_{t=1}^\\tau (1+\\sum_{i=1}^Ns^i_{t-1}r^i_t)$ ;\n",
    "- Annual return : $AnnRet = (\\frac{X_T}{X_0})^{T/250} - 1$ ;\n",
    "- Annual volatility : $AnnVol = std(\\frac{X_t}{X_{t-1}}-1)$ ;\n",
    "- Maximum drawback : $DD = min\\{\\frac{X_t}{X_{max}} - 1 : t = 1, ..., T \\}$ ;\n",
    "- Sharpe ratio : $Sharpe = \\frac{AnnRet - RiskFree}{AnnVol}$ : how much extra return you receive for the extra volatility you endure for holding a riskier asset ;\n",
    "- Calmar ratio : $Calmar = \\frac{AnnRet - RiskFree}{MaxDD}$ : like Sharpe, but instead of using volatility to assess risk, it uses the maximum drawback."
